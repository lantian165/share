--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Creating a project:

1. Auto-generate some code that eatablishes a Django project
a collection of setting for an instance of Django,
including database configuration,
Django-spicific options and application-specific settings

From the command line, cd to the directory where store the code:
$ django-admin startproject mysite

This will create a mysite directory in your current directory.

Let’s look at what startproject created:
mysite/                      # This name can be rename
    manage.py                # command-line utility
    mysite/                  # import with this name. (e.g. mysite.urls)
        __init__.py          # tells python this dir is a Python Package
        settings.py          # Setting/Configuration for this Django Project
        urls.py              # The URL declarations for this Django Project
        wsgi.py              # An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers
                             # to serve your project
                             # ( APIs for Python to communicate with web servers)
                             # The Python standard for web server and applications

The development server
Lets's verity your Django project works:
$ cd mysite
$ python manage.py runserver

Note:
   don’t use this server in anything resembling a production environment.
   It’s intended only for use while developing.

You will see the following line:
   [lanbaby@lanbaby mysite]$ python manage.py runserver
   Performing system checks...

   System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

   You have 13 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
   Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

   November 19, 2017 - 13:02:37
   Django version 1.11.7, using settings 'mysite.settings'
   Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Note: Ignore the warniing about unapplied database migrations for now.
      We will deal with it shortly

Now that server is running, visit: http://127.0.0.1:8080 with web browser,
you will see a welcome page

The default port is : 8080, you can change the port with:
$ python manage.py runserver 8080

If you want to change this server's IP, pass it along with the port:
e.g.:listen on all available public IPs:
$ python manage.py runserver 0:8080
# 0 is a shortcut for 0.0.0.0

Automatic reloading of runserver:
The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed.
you don't need to restart the server for code changes to take effect.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Creating the Polls app:

Projects vs. apps:
An app is a web application that does something - e.g. a weblog system...
A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website.
A project can contain muliple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.

We'll create our poll app right next to your manage.py file,
so that it can be imported as its own top-level module, rather than a submodule of mysite.

To create your app, make sure you're in the same directory as manage.py:
$ python manage.py startapp polls
That'll create a directory polls, which is laid out like this:
   polls/
       __init__.py
       admin.py
       apps.py
       migrations/
           __init__.py
       models.py
       tests.py
       views.py

This directory structure will house the poll application.

Open polls/views.py, put the following Python code in it:
### code begin ###
from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
### code end ###

This is the simplest view possible in Django. To call the view,
 we need to map it to a URL - and for this we need a URLconf.

To create a URLconf in the polls directory, create a file called urls.py.
 Your app directory should now look like:
   polls/
      __init__.py
      admin.py
      apps.py
      migrations/
          __init__.py
      models.py
      tests.py
      urls.py
      views.py

In the pools/urls.py file include the following code:
### code begin ###
from django.conf.urls import url

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
]
### code end ###

The next step is to point the root URLconf at the polls.urls module.
In mysite/urls.py, add an import for django.conf.urls.include
and insert an include() in the urlpatterns list:
### code begin ###
#add by manual:
from django.conf.urls import include

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

### code end ###

When to use include()
You should always use include() when you include other URL patterns.
admin.site.urls is the only exceptions to this.

You have now wired an index view into the URLconf. Lets verity it's working,
Run the following command:
$ python manage.py runserver

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/
You should see the text:
Hello, baochen. Your's at the polls index.
